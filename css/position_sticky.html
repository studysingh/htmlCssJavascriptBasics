        NITI Aayog houses a number of specialised wings, including5
 :
1. Research Wing: It develops in-house sectoral expertise as a
dedicated think tank of top notch domain experts, specialists
and scholars.
2. Consultancy Wing: It provides a marketplace of whetted panels
of expertise and funding, for the Central and State
Governments to tap into matching their requirements with
solution providers, public and private, national and
international. By playing match-maker instead of providing the
entire service itself, NITI Aayog is able to focus its resources
on priority matters, providing guidance and an overall quality
check to the rest.
3. Team India Wing: It comprises of the representatives from
every State and Ministry and serves as a permanent platform
for national collaboration. Each representative:
(a) Ensures that every State/Ministry has a continuous voice
and stake in the NITI Aayog.

State/Ministry and NITI Aayog for all development related
matters, as the dedicated liaison interface.
NITI Aayog functions in close cooperation, consultation and
coordination with the Ministries of the Central Government, and
State Governments. While it makes recommendations to the Central
and State Governments, the responsibility for taking and

interests of national security are incorporated in economic
strategy and policy.
5. To pay special attention to the sections of our society that may
be at risk of not benefitting adequately from economic
progress.
6. To design strategic and long-term policy and programme
frameworks and initiatives, and monitor their progress and their
efficacy. The lessons learnt through monitoring and feedback
will be used for making innovative improvements, including
necessary midcourse corrections.
7. To provide advice and encourage partnerships between key
stakeholders and national and international like-minded think
tanks, as well as educational and policy research institutions.
8. To create a knowledge, innovation and entrepreneurial support
system through a collaborative community of national and
international experts, practitioners and other partners.
9. To offer a platform for resolution of inter-sectoral and interdepartmental issues in order to accelerate the implementation
of the development agenda.
10. To maintain a state-of-the-art Resource Centre, be a repository
of research on good governance and best practices in
sustainable and equitable development as well as help their

11. To actively monitor and evaluate the implementation of
programmes and initiatives, including the identification of the

production, as well as actual returns that farmers get from their
produce.
3. Ensure that India is an active player in the debates and
deliberations on the global commons.

8. Use technology to reduce opacity and potential for
misadventures in governance.
The NITI Aayog aims to enable India to better face complex
challenges, through the following:7
1. Leveraging of India’s demographic dividend, and realisation of
the potential of youth, men and women, through education, skill

professionals. This convergence approach to governance is applied
to achieve the objectives of NITI Aayog.

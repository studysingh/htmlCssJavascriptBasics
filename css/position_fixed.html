Negative resistance is a concept that is often misunderstood, yet it has significant implications for the field of electronics. It is a unique type of resistance that occurs when the current flowing through a device decreases as the voltage applied to it increases. This is the opposite of what happens with traditional resistors, where the current increases as the voltage increases. In this article, we will explore the concept of negative resistance, how it works, and some of its real-world applications.
The concept of negative resistance was first proposed by John Ambrose Fleming in the early 1900s. Fleming was a British electrical engineer and inventor who is best known for inventing the vacuum tube. He was investigating the properties of vacuum tubes when he observed a negative slope in the current-voltage characteristic of a vacuum tube. This led him to conclude that negative resistance was possible.
To understand negative resistance, it is essential to first understand traditional resistance. In a resistor, the current flowing through the device is proportional to the voltage applied across it. This    Name : Sandeep Singh

To understand negative resistance, it is essential to first understand traditional resistance. In a resistor, the current flowing through the device is proportional to the voltage applied across it. This relationship is known as Ohm's Law, which states that the current (I) through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage (V) across the two points, and inversely proportional to the resistance (R) between them. Mathematically, Ohm's Law can be expressed as I = V/R.
Negative resistance, on the other hand, occurs when the current decreases as the voltage increases. In other words, the device behaves as if it has a negative resistance. This can be counterintuitive, as we typically think of resistance as a property that opposes the flow of current. However, negative resistance can occur in certain devices, such as tunnel diodes and gas discharge tubes.
